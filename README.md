# Logo-Generator

  ## Description

  This project was made to demonstrate the usage of inquirer, jest, and classes to construct a simple svg logo. I'm not certain that the jest tests are really working correctly or testing anything significant, but that can be worked on in the future still. The project also is the first that i've looked for and installed a new dependency on my own outside of a rubric. It uses the maxlength input propmt to cleanly revent users from entering characters beyond what will fit inside the generated shape.

  ## Usage

  In order to use this application please run "npm i" in the integrated console after downloading in order to install the dependencies. Then run "node index" in the integrated console and answer the prompted questions. The file will be generated and can be opened with a live server to verify it looks how you would like.

  ## Credits

  I received great assistance from my tutor Jili Jiang on this project. She helped set up the framework and helped me understand how to build into it to create the full picture. I also referenced the class-repo to see the materials we have been working on for the last two weeks. No code has been copy / pasted from another repo or website.
